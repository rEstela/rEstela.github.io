# Pytest vs Unittest

As every python developer continue working, at some point you'll encounter with
testing your applications. Python has the built-in `unittest` module but there
are other testing frameworks like `pytest` which is also popular and some
developers prefer it over `unittest`. In this article, we'll compare `pytest`
and `unittest` and see the differences between them.

Some of my main references comes from the following articles:

- Platzi's python unit testing course made by professor [Luis Mart√≠nez](https://github.com/lcmartinezdev)
- [unittest documentaiton](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)
- [pytest documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/)

DISCLAIMER: This article is not about which one is better, but it's about the differences
between them. You can choose the one that fits your needs.
