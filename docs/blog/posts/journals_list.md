# Journals That Accept Publications Free of Charge

Finding journals that offer the possibility to publish research for free can be challenging but rewarding, especially for early-career researchers and institutions with limited funding. Below I listed some journals that accept free publication based on the research topics that I use to publish, across various fields such as medical, biological, and computational sciences, along with their impact factors (IF) 2024.
