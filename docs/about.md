# About Me

üëã Hi, I‚Äôm a researcher at the **Biomedical Informatics Laboratory** of the **Heart Institute (InCor)** at **HCFMUSP**, S√£o Paulo, Brazil, where I also completed my postdoctoral fellowship. 

üî¨ My work lies at the crossroads of **Computer Science**, **Statistics**, and **Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare**. I am dedicated at learning to discover, generalize, and personalize cause-effect relationships from various observational and experimental data.

ü§ñ I'm passionate about developing AI and **machine learning** tools that promote **fair**, **explainable**, **scalable**, **reliable**, and **personalized** decision-making. 

üè• My main focus is on applications in the **Health Sciences**, where I strive to address practical challenges and help bridge the gap between theory and practice.
