# About Me

👋 Hi, I’m a researcher at the **Biomedical Informatics Laboratory** of the **Heart Institute (InCor)** at **HCFMUSP**, São Paulo, Brazil, where I also completed my postdoctoral fellowship. 

🔬 My work lies at the crossroads of **Computer Science**, **Statistics**, and **Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare**. I am dedicated at learning to discover, generalize, and personalize cause-effect relationships from various observational and experimental data.

🤖 I'm passionate about developing AI and **machine learning** tools that promote **fair**, **explainable**, **scalable**, **reliable**, and **personalized** decision-making. 

🏥 My main focus is on applications in the **Health Sciences**, where I strive to address practical challenges and help bridge the gap between theory and practice.
