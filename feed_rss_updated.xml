Today, I want to talk about something that affects millions of people around the globe: cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Did you know that CVDs are the leading cause of death worldwide? It&#39;s a staggering fact, especially in low- and middle-income countries, where they account for about 80% of these deaths. That&#39;s not just a number; it&#39;s a wake-up call for all of us!&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://rEstela.github.io/blog/2024/10/06/the-importance-of-early-detection-in-cardiovascular-diseases/</link> <pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 17:04:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://rEstela.github.io/feed_rss_updated.xml">Estela's personal site</source><guid isPermaLink="true">https://rEstela.github.io/blog/2024/10/06/the-importance-of-early-detection-in-cardiovascular-diseases/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Journals That Accept Publications Free of Charge</title> <description>&lt;h1&gt;Journals That Accept Publications Free of Charge&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding journals that offer the possibility to publish research for free can be challenging but rewarding, especially for early-career researchers and institutions with limited funding.

Think about it: when we play an instrument, it’s not just our ears at work. Our motor skills, vision, and memory all get a workout too. That’s why, over the years, researchers have come to see music as a unique way to study how our brains adapt and change—what we call &#34;neuroplasticity.&#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, it’s natural to wonder: if playing music can help our brains grow stronger, could it also help slow down the cognitive decline that often comes with aging?&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://rEstela.github.io/blog/2024/10/05/music-and-aging-can-learning-an-instrument-keep-our-minds-sharp/</link> <pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 17:04:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://rEstela.github.io/feed_rss_updated.xml">Estela's personal site</source><guid isPermaLink="true">https://rEstela.github.io/blog/2024/10/05/music-and-aging-can-learning-an-instrument-keep-our-minds-sharp/</guid> </item> <item> <title>How Music Transforms the Brain: Uncovering the Power of Neuroplasticity</title> <description>&lt;h1&gt;How Music Transforms the Brain: Uncovering the Power of Neuroplasticity&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi, everyone! Today, I want to dive into something that fascinates me: how music has the power to transform our brains. Over the last few decades, science has made incredible strides in this area, especially with the help of neuroimaging – those techniques that let us see what’s happening in our minds in amazing detail.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://rEstela.github.io/blog/2024/10/05/how-music-transforms-the-brain-uncovering-the-power-of-neuroplasticity/</link> <pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 17:04:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://rEstela.github.io/feed_rss_updated.xml">Estela's personal site</source><guid isPermaLink="true">https://rEstela.github.io/blog/2024/10/05/how-music-transforms-the-brain-uncovering-the-power-of-neuroplasticity/</guid> </item> <item> <title>AI in Medicine: The Challenge of Trusting What We Don’t Fully Understand</title> <description>&lt;h1&gt;AI in Medicine: The Challenge of Trusting What We Don’t Fully Understand&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early days of artificial intelligence, machine learning models were pretty straightforward. We could look at them and understand how they worked. But things have changed. Today, the most powerful AI systems, especially those using deep learning, are almost impossible for us to “see inside.” This has made them incredibly useful for tasks like analyzing medical data, including diagnosing heart conditions through ECG signals. These deep neural networks (DNNs) are impressively accurate but bring a significant challenge: they operate as “black boxes”—producing results without showing us how they got there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s dig a little deeper into why this is such a big deal, especially in the field of medicine.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://rEstela.github.io/blog/2024/10/06/ai-in-medicine-the-challenge-of-trusting-what-we-dont-fully-understand/</link> <pubDate>Thu, 21 Aug 2025 17:04:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://rEstela.github.io/feed_rss_updated.xml">Estela's personal site</source><guid isPermaLink="true">https://rEstela.github.io/blog/2024/10/06/ai-in-medicine-the-challenge-of-trusting-what-we-dont-fully-understand/</guid> </item> </channel></rss>
